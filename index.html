              Drinking alcohol too much or too often, or being unable to control
              alcohol consumption, can be a sign of a larger problem. Two
              different issues that some people can develop are alcohol abuse or
              alcoholism, also known as alcohol dependency.These terms are
              sometimes used interchangeably, but there are marked differences.
              People who abuse alcohol drink too much on occasion and their
              drinking habits often result in risky behavior and poor judgment.
              But alcohol abusers generally are not dependent on alcohol.
              Alcoholism, on the other hand, means a person needs alcohol to get
              through their day.

            <p class="card-text">
              Drug abuse is the use of illegal drugs or the use of prescription
              or over-the-counter medications in ways other than recommended or
              intended. It also includes intentional inhalation of household or
              industrial chemicals for their mind-altering effects. Tobacco use
              and problem drinking are sometimes included in the definition of
              drug abuse. Chemical abuse and substance abuse are terms sometimes
              used interchangeably with the term drug abuse, or they may be used
              to refer to a combination of drug abuse and tobacco use or problem
              drinking. Many drugs that are abused are also addictive
